			<h1>We are back for 2024</h1>
				<p>2024 operations will commence on Father’s Day weekend, June 15 and 16. The winter of 2023/2024 saw not one, but two historic flooding events that caused considerable damage to our line. These damages have now been repaired and test trains have been run over the line two days this week. There will be three trains per day this weekend departing Sanders station at 11 AM, noon, and 1 PM. You are free to depart on one train and return on a later one if you care to bring a picnic lunch or spend more time exploring our roundhouse and other historic buildings. We have a vintage handcar at the roundhouse that everyone is encouraged to take a spin on. Kids of all ages, including Dad’s seem to love this attraction.

			<br>
				Please note that we’ve recently experienced a problem with our web host and have had to restore the website to where it was on 31 December 2022. Bear with us while we rebuild and update the website. We are a volunteer based organization with no paid employees. We will be updating the 2024 operating schedule shortly.</p>
			<h1>Franklin County’s Unique Narrow Gauge Railroad</h1>
				<p>The Sandy River and Rangeley Lakes Railroad is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, tax-exempt foundation dedicated to the preservation and restoration of one of the original two-foot narrow gauge railroads that were unique to the state of Maine. This railroad, located in the mountainous region of Franklin County, was the longest of the five two-foot railways that once serviced the state. The fans of the SR&RL RR span the globe, with our log book entries for visitors from the likes of the United Kingdom, Wales, Germany, and Australia to prove it. <a href="../about/about.html" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>
			<h1>Community</h1>
				<p>Our Community in Franklin County is an integral part of who we are. Our commitment to historical preservation could never be a success without the support and volunteers we have met and who have worked with us toward the mutual goal of youth involvement through education. Read More
