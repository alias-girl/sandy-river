# How to View the Current SRRL Website

## There are two different ways to view the unpublished website:
* Downloading the ZIP file,
* or cloning the git repository.

If you don't know what that second one means, then fret not, because I won't be covering it unless it becomes necessary.

## Step 1. Go to the main page @ https://github.com/alias-girl/sandy-river/
* You will see a lot of stuff.

* it may be intimidating to look at, but there's only one thing you'll have to worry about on this page, and it's the most noticable (and probably most simple) thing on the page:
 
## Step 2. Click the green button that says '<> Code' inside.
* You should find it in the top right of the main bulk of content.
* It's also to the left of the 'About' section that is on the right side.

* Once you click on the green '<> Code' button, a dropdown will open up. 

## Step 3. In this dropdown, click the button that says 'download ZIP'.
* There should be a little symbol of a zipped folder to the left of it.

## Step 4. This step is not necessary unless you have a specific setting turned on in your browser.
* If it is turned on, then a new window will pop up after you press the 'Download ZIP' button, asking you where you'd like to put the ZIP.
  * For ease of access, just put it in the Documents folder.
* If there is no popup asking where you would like to place the ZIP, then open your browser's download queue and click the button to select the ZIP in your File Explorer.

## Step 5. Once it has finished downloading, open the ZIP folder by either:
* left clicking the downloaded file in your browser's download queue.
* Left clicking the button for locating the ZIP in your File Explorer, then double left-clicking the selected ZIP file.

## Step 6. Once it opens, there will be a folder inside it that has the same exact name as the .ZIP folder. You will need to extract this folder one of two ways:
* Left click that folder once to select it, then click and hold it, then drag your mouse to hover over the pinned 'Documents' folder under Quick Access, then let go of your mouse.
* Right-clicking the ZIP file, then clicking "extract All...", then selecting your 'Documents' folder once prompted.
* Once you've completed this step, go to your documents folder and find the folder you just extracted.

## Step 7. Locate and double left-click the folder you just extracted from the ZIP file.
* In Windows 10/11, you can directly search by file name by simply typing the first few letters of the folder's name while in the Documents folder.

## Step 8. Once inside, double click the 'sandy-river-(MM-DD-YY)' folder.
* Any new updates to the SRRL webpage must be extracted as the entire website with the date of contribution attached to the end of the folder name.
* If the current team knows what they're doing, there should only be a single folder.

## Step 9. Once inside the folder with the date of the last push to the repository, there will be two files with the name 'index'.
* One of these files is the HTML, responsible for wireframing the layout and contents of the webpage. The other file is the CSS, which is responsible for the stylization and fancy graphics attached to the HTML.
* right-click the file called 'index.html' and inside the subsequent menu there should be an option that says "Open with >".
  * If you cannot see any file with '.html' on the end (or any files with extensions at all), you can go to the 'View' dropdown in the Windows File Explorer, navigate to the 'Show' section, and ticking the box labelled "File Name Extensions" to enabled.
* Hover over the "Open with >" button and left-click your browser of choice from the presented list.
  * If your desired browser does not appear, you can also left-click the option at the very bottom that says "Choose another app", and Windows should be able to determine a few apps that weren't previously listed as capable of opening the file.
  * If your desired browser is in this secondary list of applications, simply left-click on it and it should open it.
## Step 11. You should now be able to view the home page of the new website. It's still unfinished and pretty poorly optimized, thanks to my incompetence, so don't get too excited.
