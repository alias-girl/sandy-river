### Accessibility:
*How will the website accommodate people with disabilities?*
* Make the website usable by those with impairments or disabilities without ruining the experience of website visitors who don't have any kinds of impairments. It's really not that hard.
* Attach alternate text to all images on the entire website for screenreaders.

## Region 9 Task List:
* Finish up with putting relevant and up-to-date information on all pages (Once provided by Guy)
* Tidy up and standardize the layout as well as any and all stylization with room for improvement
  * (Seriously turn down the corner rounding it looks pretty corny now)
* Set relevant and thorough standards for future contributors
* Begin with setting up the SRRL Shopify page
* Attach W3C-Compliant alternate text to all images on the entire website for screenreaders
* While we're at it, just try not to make the website impossible to use for people with impairments or disabilities.
* I'd rather not continue being the "owner" of the GitHub Repository, so at some point the future Project Manager should get in contact with me so I can transfer ownership to them (I don't actually know if this is even possible, but we'll figure it out when we get there).
* Speaking of the GitHub, there are absolutely no images whatsoever for the tutorial documentation. Maybe I should get to that.
* Optional: See if you can figure out a better way to do the sub-pages than I did.

## SRRL Task List:
* Gather all SRRL accounts and their information and send them back in a list. It would probably be in your best interest to delete the sent email after about a month, at the very most.
* Collect all relevant and up-to-date information on each of the page subjects and relay it to the Region 9 developers in a concise and formatted order, preferably in order of webpage navigation from left to right.
