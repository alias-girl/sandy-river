I still don't know how to use GitHub.

Complete overhaul of the home page. 
Still a pretty barebones WIP, but 
1. the nav bar is functional and is separated from the main CSS page, 
2. the spacing between and within the elements now utilizes the font size (em), 
3. and finally, the <main> and <footer> elements are now implemented and ready.
